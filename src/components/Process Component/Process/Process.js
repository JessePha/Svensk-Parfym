The volatility and behaviour of these fantastic molecules depend totally on their structures and on environmental physical circumstances, temperature and humidity being the most important ones. All unique inventions needs bold creativity. Perfumery needs both unique inventions and total constancy - they are just different parts of the process; first invention then full systematic consistency.",

Svensk Parfym is definitely a niche brand in the sense that we focus entirely on fine fragrances. Niche is the best you can find if there is much dedication and talent behind it and consequently niche is very poor if there isnâ€™t.",
